I've worked quite a lot over the past few years. Since lockdown, month by month
it got more and more out of control. I decided in mid 2022 that one way or
another this would change, and the date it would change would be Jan 1st 2023.

If you've not worked a significant management role before it might seem surprising
for it to take six months to do it. Well it does. My employer, my team, and my
self have had to prepare a fair bit.

Fortunately Jan 1st came and since then I've been working my job 9am to 6pm.
This is good. I think my loved ones honestly did not expect me to actually do it!

In any case, I find myself with a lot more time. I set myself the expectation
that I wouldn't need to decide what to do with this time immediately. I'd just
make sure I did have that time and wasn't using it to work, and trusted I'd
figure out what to do with it.

Before getting sucked into work, I was always a person with a project, even as
a teenager. Websites, art projects, largely unsuccessful novel writing, various
other bits.

So after a bit of getting used to having evenings and weekends again, plus
unfucking my habitat and reaffirming the way I want to live my relationships, I've
still got a fair bit of spare time I'm itching to use.

However, I'm also aware I can slip into old habits, so I need a couple rules to
keep me living within certain barriers. I'm pretty good with a self-imposed rule.
Flexibility is harder, but that's OK for now.

My first rule was:

1. I work my job entirely between 9am and 6pm.

And I'm going to add a rule pertaining to my outside of work projects:

2. Any project with a job dependency must happen in work hours.

So, if there's a work deadline, or someone's waiting on it, or it's going to
form part of a larger project which is important for work, it has to be done
inside work hours.

I might want to do projects that do relate to my job, and possibly will even be
used by me in my job. However if there is anything at my job that is depending
on a non-job project, or if that becomes the case at any point, I can only work
on it in work hours.

If a project is related to my job in some way, it will be a good idea to avoid the
possibility of it becoming a job-project by making it less useful. For example,
making it a proof of concept, or require significant customisation, documentation,
or integration before it can be useful.

Those 'bottom lines' are _towards_ my 'top lines' related to me having a full
life. In particular, rule 2 is related to the top line of "I work on a range of
projects inside, outside, or adjacent to work — without getting sucked in."

Another bottom line is that:

3. Every project outside of work hours must be scoped in my logs.

This is useful in general, but is in particular essential to ensure I don't get
unwittingly sucked in. Writing is a good way to exercise executive control.

I'd like to create a piece of software that can analyse a screen recording of
someone coding for the purposes of process review. It should:

* Be somehow consumable by a web or local interface.
* Be economical to run.
* Ideally not rely on ML cloud APIs, which will increase maintenance burden.
* Be capable of rebuilding the codebase (in full or part) that is being worked
  on, probably by capturing line numbers and such.
* Be capable of annotating particular key moments in the recording, for example
  a test suite passing or failing, an edit of a particular file or even line,
  a build, or something else.
* Produce searchable results.
* Be robust to a reasonable variety of inputs. Let's say we can fix the editor
  to be VS Code but not the theme or layout.
* Be configurable to different languages / toolsets (e.g. Ruby, Python, etc)
* Perhaps, be robust to the use of in-IDE tools (e.g. to run tests)
* Be capable of handling a variety of video input formats.
* It would be nice to consider how we could handle files (e.g config) that are
  necessary to get the code running but that aren't visible on the recording.
  Maybe some kind of start and end snapshot?

Probably a rudimentary visualisation tool will be important for this to feel
motivating to me. But not cool enough to be distracting. Maybe a browser based
video display with timestamps and text display of analysis at the current point.

Be cool to make this a mac app, but it's probably going to be distracting.

As is the general focus of my engineering practice at the moment, I should aim
to be as fast as possible (I will write up an essay at some point titled 'Speed
is a form of quality' — because it is). It might make sense to make videos of
my process also, since it'll be more fuel for the tool.

My first step is to:

- [ ] Make a proof of concept script that can detect when a test fail or pass
      has happened, and generate a list of timestamps.
