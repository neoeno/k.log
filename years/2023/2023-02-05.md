Let's talk a bit about ambition.

Earlier today I was doing one of my weekly routines — a walk to the bakery to
get lunch. When I do this I listen to podcasts and audiobooks and such. At the
moment I'm on a bit of a jcarmack kick. First Masters Of Doom, now the recent
Lex interview with him.

My mind was in and out today, because I was also having all kinds of ideas for
projects. I think actually completing my last one has been very stimulating. I
say 'actually' because my projects usually don't get finished. They're typically
too big, too sprawling, too ambitious — and as a result I get tired and
discouraged not getting anything actually done. Then I give up.

But this time I completed something. Why?

Firstly, I have cut down my job hours a lot (to 9-6). This has given me a lot
more energy to spend on these things.

Secondly, I set out some rules to combat the workaholic behaviours I've picked
up in the past few years. Keeping it separated from work was quite key — it
stopped me hyping things up too much and generating in my mind the idea of
unmanageable expectations.

Finally, I scoped it small. I've been noticing for a while that people who
create great things typically don't just walk off one day and build their grand
vision. These projects often come after a great many smaller projects, studies,
investigative works.

Which, when you think about it, is pretty obvious. Often this is due to an
everyday forcing function — say, needing to build something to sell pretty
quick. That was how the jcarmack/id software story goes at the beginning.

(There's that speed = quality idea coming up again...)

But it is annoying! Because I'm impatient to get to the really exciting vision!
And deep down I sort of do believe I don't really need to build my skills before
I can execute on it.

But I do. A nice middle ground is building an intermediate but connected step
towards it. It doesn't need to be trivially achievable but it probably should
have only one or two genuine mysteries.

So. Onwards.

But before that we sort of need to work out what to do about confidentiality in
these files...

OK — I've set up encryption in my local editor. Probably the easiest way for
now.

So here's an interesting idea for the previous video project: pumping the OCR'd
frame into a large language model (LLM). Take a look at this exchange.

First, the original screenshot:

![Coding screenshot](images/frame-000000692.png)

Next, the OCR into a prompt.

If I instead ask it:

It responds:

Not perfect, but pretty damn good. Better segmentation and OCR, plus some prompt
engineering, might get us results we could use for a great many purposes. I'm
thinking there may be something in this!

Idea came from a post on Mastodon that linked to [this gist about summarising
youtube
videos.](https://gist.github.com/simonw/9932c6f10e241cfa6b19a4e08b283ca9)
