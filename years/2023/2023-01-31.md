So we're pretty much at the point where we can take a video, snap each second,
and then transcribe each frame well enough to label some predictable things. I
think I've resolved the memory issue (but we'll see).

I'd like at some point to get this running on a cloud provider — ultimately
for this to be at all useful it'll need to be running there. I think a docker
container running with some sort of serverless approach? Something like that.
But I won't do that now.

Now we're going to think about the interface!

- [x] Design the interface
- [x] Create a HTML/CSS/JS app to display these videos
- [x] Make a git repository and README

OK — so I've coded up an interface and a basic function to extract the events.
The events are going to be more complicated than I hoped. Here's a sample output:

```
988: 8 examples, 8 failures, 1 errer
992: 0 examples, 8 failures, 1 errer
993: 2 examples, 8 failures, 1 errer
994: 8 examples, 8 failures, 1 errer
1002: 12 examples, 0 failures, 4 pending
1017: 12 exasples, 1 failure, 3 pending
1019: 12 examples, 1 failure, 3 pending
1028: 12 exatples, 1 failure
1031: 12 exanples, 1 failure
```

There clearly is structure there, but we're going to have to do some fuzzy
matching in order to extract it. Also those 8s are supposed to be 0s... a bit
icky. We're going to have to think a bit about this one.

In terms of my process, I got a bit muddled with this one trying to push things
together and then getting lost in the fiddling. This is a persistent process trap
for me. Doesn't immediately occur to me how to fix it — let's call it 'local muddling'.
To reflect the idea that I get stuck in a local minima and spend too long muddling
about trying to climb out of it when really I need to rethink.

What I need to figure is:

* What events would I like to extract?
* How can I reliably extract them from the data I have?
  * See if there's any way to improve extract quality (green hued text is still
    pretty compromised - actually I just did make some progress on this)
  * Can I use fuzzy string matching in some way
  * Can I exploit similarities in sequential frames in some way?
* Write some code to do it.

I'll call it a day here.
