From the previous assignment:

> If a person is committed to creating great things that bear fruit over the long term, bringing others on board is an essential task. In ignoring this task, they can bring about only two possible consequences: the project fails, or new endeavours must be refused. While the importance of hiring to the organisation is obvious (many meaningful things can only be done by a group), its importance to the individual person is more subtle. It requires the acknowledgement of personal limits. It has taken me some time.

JD's drafted, the next step is to prepare and build the machine for bringing the new roles into place. Here's a rough outline:

* Communicating the intended outcome to the team through a few different lenses
  * Functional (what people will do)
  * Structural (reporting lines)
  * Emotional (how it will feel)
  * Strategic (what problems will be solved or opportunities caught)
  * Time
* Completing the whole plan for recruitment
  * JDs finalized
  * Recruitment timelines
  * Candidate packs
  * Interviewer packs (with scorecards)
* Delegating the plan to relevant people

I have a deadline for sharing this with the team on Wednesday.

Tasks in rough order:

- [ ] Prepare interviewer packs
- [ ] Prepare candidate packs
- [ ] Finalize JDs (blocked)
- [ ] Post JDs
- [ ] Prepare presentation to the team
- [ ] Prepare scorecards
- [ ] Brief recruiters or similar
