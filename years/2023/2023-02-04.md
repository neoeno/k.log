I'm currently messing around with trying to train Tesseract to recognise my
particular font. I think I'll try this just today and see how far I get.

I've trained it on some right fonts. Marginal improvements with my preferred
font but for recordings using Menlo with the crossbarred `0` character it makes
a big improvement to our ability to find strings like `0 failures`.

OK! Proof of concept done. Looks pretty neat.

Project done! Very nice. I guess I now get to decide what I want to do next.

I think I'm going to do an ESFA data analyser. A couple of ideas of what it
could do:

* A stacked chart of apprenticeship providers delivery of seats over time.
* A stacked chart of apprenticeships an individual provider is delivering.
* Probably a bunch of other things.
* Might be nice to have a 'sign for to updates for this view'.

I think probably the way to go about this is to make the charts I'd like to see
using some data vis tools â€” and then work on a way of implementing them on
a web interface.
