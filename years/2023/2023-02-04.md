I'm currently messing around with trying to train Tesseract to recognise my
particular font. I think I'll try this just today and see how far I get.

I've trained it on some right fonts. Marginal improvements with my preferred
font but for recordings using Menlo with the crossbarred `0` character it makes
a big improvement to our ability to find strings like `0 failures`.

OK! Proof of concept done. Looks pretty neat.
